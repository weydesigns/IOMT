Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.

Immediate Steps
To address this issue, try restarting the device and updating its firmware to the latest version. Ensure that all default passwords are changed to strong, unique ones, and disable any unnecessary network services. If the issue persists, consider factory resetting the device after backing up necessary data.

Long-Term Steps
For long-term protection, regularly update the device firmware and security patches. Implement network segmentation to isolate medical devices from other network traffic and utilize a VPN for remote access if needed. Regularly monitor device logs and network traffic for unusual activity. 

Recommendations
Consult the device manufacturer for further guidance and ensure all users are trained in basic cybersecurity practices. Regularly review and update security policies to keep pace with new threats.
